# What is this?

An API proxy for [Traxsource](https://www.traxsource.com/) (a website that sells house music) written in Ruby on Rails. It can be installed on your server or Heroku and used to provide structured data for your app derived from the content on Traxsource. It tries to play nice by caching results in MongoDB so that it doesn't hammer Traxsource with repeated requests.
